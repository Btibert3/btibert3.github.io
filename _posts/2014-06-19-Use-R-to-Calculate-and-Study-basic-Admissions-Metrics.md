# Use R to Calculate and Study basic Admissions Metrics


We were talking about admit rates at work, and as luck would have it, I
saw the tweet below coming out of the Eduventures conference basically
the same day.

> More than 70% of American colleges accept everyone who applies. Only
> 200 colleges accept less than 50% of applicants

Because we can download full survey datasets from IPEDS, it's fairly
simple to hack something together fairly quickly to test this ourselves.
I won't say much other than to say I found more than 200 schools, but
the difference is trivial.  

All of my R code can be found
[here](https://github.com/Btibert3/ug-admit-rate). Poke around the repo
if these sort of datasets are interesting to you.  

I also have a few plots that highlights what we can do with the datasets. 

Lastly, it's worth noting that the data folder has a CSV file that you can bring into
Tableau (or your visualization software of choice) to explore and
slice/dice the data even further.
