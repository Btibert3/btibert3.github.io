	<h1>Forecast College Enrollment</h1>

<p>As of late, there has been a surge in conversation around the topic of
the <code>college-going population</code> here in the United States.</p>

<p>One one hand, we have long talked about the &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; of
demographics. For example, here is a simple <a href="http://goo.gl/T3OyCF">Google
Search</a>. On the other, the decline in college
enrollment, has been connected to changes in the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-high-school-grads-decide-college-isnt-worth-it/">labor
market</a>.</p>

<p>In the end, it might be nice to review what data exist and highlight how
these flashy headlines could have been predictable well in advance of
2014.</p>

<h2>About this post</h2>

<p>For this post, I will be using using the <code>R</code> language to download the
data from <a href="http://www.wiche.edu/knocking-8th">WICHE</a>, an amazing
resource for projections of High School graduates by state. Using these
data, we can do all sorts of fun analyses.</p>

<p>In a future post, I will show you how to link WICHE to
<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds">IPEDS</a> data in order to forecast college
participation rates by state.</p>

<p>While I will provide a few code snippets below, you should feel free to
clone my <a href="https://github.com/Btibert3/Parse-WICHE">Github Repo</a> which
everything you need to replicate this post.</p>

<p>Also included is a Tableau Workbook. If you have Tableau Desktop, this
super basic workbook highlights how you can leverage parameters to
create your own forecasts.</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot of the workbook, which is a basic &quot;Create-Your-Own
College Enrollment Forecast&quot; of sorts.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Btibert3/Parse-WICHE/master/figs/Tableau.PNG" alt="Tableau-ss"></p>

<h2>Why this post</h2>

<p>The changing demographics and volume of students that would be
considering a college education should not be news to anyone in
Enrollment Management. I hope to highlight how with just a few lines of
code, we can:</p>

<ol>
<li> Grab data that forecasts the volume of high school graduates</li>
<li> Use <code>R</code> to parse, clean, and reshape the data (originally stored in
Excel)</li>
<li> Save out the data and leverage Tableau to do some basic forecasting</li>
</ol>

<p>For those of you that might be new to <code>R</code>, reading code can be extremely
helpful when attempting to learn a new language. When possible, I always
try to comment the heck of out my code. Hopefully these comments can
help you in your journey.</p>

<h2>Get the data</h2>

<p>With <code>R</code>, it&#39;s super simple to grab data from the web. The command below
will download the WICHE Excel Workbook.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">## download the dataset into your working directory
## use mode option below so the file can open in R, error w/o it
WICHE_DATA = &quot;http://wiche.edu/info/knocking-8th/tables/allProjections.xlsx&quot;
download.file(url=WICHE_DATA, destfile=&quot;raw/wiche.xlsx&quot;, mode=&quot;wb&quot;)
</code></pre></div>
<p>It should be noted that the code above assumes that your current
directory (where you are running the code) has a folder called <code>raw</code>. To
assure that this is the case, just do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">## ensure that we have a directory to store the raw data
if (!file.exists(&quot;raw&quot;)) dir.create(&quot;raw&quot;)
if (!file.exists(&quot;figs&quot;)) dir.create(&quot;figs&quot;)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can use the <code>RODBC</code> package (on Windows) to connect to the
workbook and query it as if the sheets were database tables.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">xl = odbcConnectExcel2007(&quot;raw/wiche.xlsx&quot;)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Because each state is a tab in the workbook, let&#39;s use <code>R</code> to define an
object that holds the state abbreivations, which we will use while
looping through the workbook.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">## how cool is it that R has the State names and Abbreviations preloaded?
?state.name
(states = state.name)
length(states)
states = c(states, &quot;District of Columbia&quot;)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, let&#39;s loop and build a dataset in the format we want:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">## use a for loop -- not ideal but easy to read and debug
wiche = data.frame(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
for (state in states) {
 raw = sqlFetch(xl, state, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
 ## bc there is a structure to each sheet, we can reference each column by index
 ## no way is this ideal, but quick when data doesnt change
 ROWS = 9:40
 COLS = c(1, 3:10)
 ## create a flag for actual/projected -- hard coded from looking at Excel file
 status = c(rep(&quot;actual&quot;, 13), rep(&quot;projected&quot;, 19))
 ## keep the data
 df = raw[ROWS, COLS]
 colnames(df) = c(&#39;year&#39;,
                  &#39;pub_amind&#39;,
                  &#39;pub_asian&#39;,
                  &#39;pub_black&#39;,
                  &#39;pub_hisp&#39;,
                  &#39;pub_white&#39;,
                  &#39;pub_total&#39;,
                  &#39;np_total&#39;,
                  &#39;total&#39;)
 ## remove the commas -- using a for loop not ideal, but intuitive
 for (i in 2:ncol(df)) {
  df[,i] = as.numeric(gsub(&quot;,&quot;,&quot;&quot;, df[,i]))
 }
 df$state = state
 df$status = status
 ## bind onto the master data frame
 wiche = rbind.fill(wiche, df)
 ## status
 cat(&quot;finished &quot;, state, &quot;\n&quot;)
}
</code></pre></div>
<h2>A quick plot</h2>

<p>When playing around with data, it&#39;s usually a good practice to visualize
what you have. Below is a quick plot which represents both the actual
and forecasted volume of high school graduates going until the 2027/28
Academic year.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Btibert3/Parse-WICHE/master/figs/Total-HS-Grads.jpg" alt="plot"></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I would encourage the reader to browse the code, and if possible, fire
up the Tableau workbook. As an Enrollment Scientist, <code>R</code> and <code>Tableau</code>
are my two tools that I use on a daily basis.</p>
